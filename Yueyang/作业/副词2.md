Your sister bought a car excitedly last week 

The doctor is climbing this mountain slowly now 

My nanny will cook beef patiently upstairs tomorrow

Those mothers chat pretty loudly here

His friend discusses this problem quite loudly there

The student finishes homework pretty patiently at home every day

She always learns English patiently here every week

The worker often drives his car patiently every day

Jack's son is brushing this window angrily now

Her husband baked corn slowly nearby yesterday
