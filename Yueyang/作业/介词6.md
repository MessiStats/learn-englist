The bed inside my room is very big

The data inside my computer is very expensive

The bird is inside my pocket

The children are playing a game inside my house

You is inside my mind



He work hard like me

The policeman is like an actor

The horse is like a donkey

The bread is like a store

Like me, he also runs every day



The river near my school is very deep

The woman sells milk tea near the bank

My leader buys a house near the sea

He is near 30 years old 

Her husband bakes beef near the cinema



He is his father of the man , Jack

I like her daughter of the woman near the door 

The famous actress is the son of his mother, Rose

She will marry the son of the lawyer, Tim

I am meeting the daughter of my boss, Helen



We run around the playground

Her mother sells apples around the station

The children are playing a game around the school

Those pigs are around the food 

The hotels around the college are very expensive
