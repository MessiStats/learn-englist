My hat is more expensive than his

Her watch is cheaper than mine

His car is bigger than mine

Their ship smaller than ours



My pencil is not longer than hers

Her bed is not smaller than mine

Our book is not heavier than theirs

Your house is not more beautiful than mine



My student is as rich as her

My brother is as tall as him

Her mother is as beautiful as me

His pen is as long as her



My father is the best in the world 

My mother is the best in the world 

My girlfriend is the more beautiful in my heart

His computer is the more famous in China 

Her key is the more smallest in ShenZhen

Your sofa is the more widest in GuangDong
